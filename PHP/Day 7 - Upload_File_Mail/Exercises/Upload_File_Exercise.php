		1. On PHPMYADMIN, edit the 'user' table and add a new attribute : poster (if needed).
		2. Edit 'register.php' : Add the input to upload a file on the register form
		3. Create the PHP code that will save the file on the server ('uploads' folder)
		4. Grab the name of the image (only the name) and save it in the DB.
		5. Make the picture name to be the username.
