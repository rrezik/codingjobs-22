/*
	This exercise is based on the 'login/register' exercise.
	
	Now, we have implemented the register/login process into the same project.

	Step 1. Create a 'nav.php' file that contains the two links : register / login
            Create a link also for the home page (index file)
            Include this file on all the pages.
    5Min

    Step 2. Edit 'login.php' page.
    Once the user is logged-in, create a cookie 'login' to true.

    Step 3.	If the user is loggued-in, hide 'login' & 'register' links.
