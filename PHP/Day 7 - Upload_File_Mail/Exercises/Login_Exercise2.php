	This exercise is based on the 'login/register' exercise.
	
	Now, we have implemented the register/login process into the same project.

	Step 1. Create a 'nav.php' file that contains the two links : register / login
            Create a link also for the home page (index file)
            Include this file on all the pages.
    5Min

    Step 2. Edit 'login.php' page.
    Once the user is logged-in, create a cookie 'login' to true.

    Step 3.	If the user is loggued-in, hide 'login' & 'register' links.

    Step 4. Create a logout button. When you click on it, it should remove the cookie previously created in the login process.

    Step 5. Hide the logout button when user is not connected.
    Display the button when user is connected
