    - Step 2 :
        If the form is submitted, you have to check :
            * username, mail and password must not be empty !
            * mail must be a valid one
            * passwords must be the same 
        
        You have to clean the inputs using trim and/or htmlspecialchars.
        Display a different message for each validation/error.

    - Step 3 :
        If everything is good, insert the new user in the DB !

        You have to encrypt the password !
